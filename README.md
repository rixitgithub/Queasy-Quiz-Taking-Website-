# 📚 About the Project

## 🌟 Inspiration

While discussing with one of my professors, she expressed her frustration with current quiz platforms like Google Forms. These platforms, she explained, are not tailored for creating quizzes, allowing for easy cheating and lacking user-friendliness. Despite their inadequacies, they were forced to use them due to a lack of better alternatives. This conversation sparked my motivation to develop **Queazy**, a website dedicated to helping teachers create and administer quizzes efficiently while providing detailed analytics for both students and teachers.
